# Karnaugh Map

K-map can take two forms:

1. Sum of product (SOP)
2. Product of Sum (POS)

**Steps to Solve Expression using K-map**

    1. Select the K-map according to the number of variables.
    2. Identify minterms or maxterms as given in the problem.
    3. For SOP put 1’s in blocks of K-map respective to the minterms (0’s elsewhere).
    4. For POS put 0’s in blocks of K-map respective to the max terms (1’s elsewhere).
    5. Make rectangular groups containing total terms in power of two like 2,4,8 ..(except 1) and try to cover as many elements as you can in one group.
    6. From the groups made in step 5 find the product terms and sum them up for SOP form.
